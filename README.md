# Sponsor Presentations: Best Practices for Using Python to Power Serverless Applications

Capital One uses Python to power a large number of serverless applications to improve developer experience and increase customer value. Because Python enables fast development cycles, engineers and data scientists at Capital One have more time to focus on delighting our customers. Our Python development is also more potent on serverless as it eliminates multiple overhead requirements. In this talk, we will cover best practices we've learned along the way for using Python to build serverless solutions to enable a fast, intuitive and iterative developer experience for:

- API calls
- Streaming data
- Machine learning inference

Attendees will learn the techniques and tools available when using Python to build a production-grade serverless system complete with observability and development practices baked in without ever provisioning a server. The presentation will feature a demonstration of Python-based AWS Lambda functions-as-a-service.
